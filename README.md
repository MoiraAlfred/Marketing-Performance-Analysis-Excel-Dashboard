# Marketing Performance Analysis Dashboard  
Excel Based Marketing Analytics Project

---

# 1. Project Overview

This project is a structured Marketing Performance Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to analyze campaign effectiveness through interactive KPI tracking and weekly trend analysis. The dashboard consolidates marketing performance indicators into a single analytical view, allowing users to evaluate reach, engagement, efficiency and profitability.

The core objective of this project is to demonstrate how Excel can function as a complete analytics environment using PivotTables, calculated measures, and time based filtering to produce business ready insights.

# 2. File Structure

The Excel workbook contains the following sheets:

## Analysis  
This is the primary dashboard sheet. It contains KPI summaries, weekly breakdowns, and interactive components.

## Visual  
Currently reserved for future visual expansions or design experiments.

## Info  
Reserved for metadata, documentation, or dataset reference.

---

# 3. Dashboard Components

The Analysis sheet is structured into logical performance sections.

## 3.1 KPI Summary Section

The top section of the dashboard displays aggregated marketing performance indicators:

- Total Impressions  
- Total Clicks  
- Average Conversion Rate  
- Average Acquisition Cost  
- Return On Investment  

These KPIs dynamically update when filters are applied, ensuring real time responsiveness within Excel.

### Purpose of Each KPI

Total Impressions measures overall marketing reach.  
Total Clicks reflects engagement levels.  
Average Conversion Rate evaluates effectiveness in turning clicks into conversions.  
Average Acquisition Cost measures cost efficiency.  
Return On Investment evaluates overall campaign profitability.

---

## 3.2 Weekly Performance Analysis

The dashboard includes time based PivotTable summaries:

- Impressions by Weeks  
- Clicks by Weeks  
- Average Conversion Rate by Weeks  

This enables temporal trend evaluation and performance consistency analysis.

A Timeline slicer is connected to these PivotTables, allowing the user to filter by date and observe performance shifts across time periods.

# 4. Analytical Methodology

## Step 1 – Data Structuring

The dataset was structured to ensure compatibility with PivotTables and calculated measures. Fields were organized to support:

- Time based aggregation  
- KPI calculation  
- Weekly grouping  
- Dynamic filtering  

Proper formatting of numeric and date columns ensures accurate aggregation.

---

## Step 2 – KPI Calculation Logic

Key performance metrics were derived using calculated fields and aggregation logic.

Conversion Rate was computed using click to conversion relationships.  
Acquisition Cost was derived by relating marketing spend to total conversions.  
ROI was calculated by comparing revenue against marketing spend.  

Each metric was validated to ensure logical consistency and financial accuracy.

---

## Step 3 – PivotTable Configuration

PivotTables were configured to:

- Aggregate metrics at total level  
- Break down performance by week  
- Support dynamic filtering  
- Maintain consistent formatting  

The Timeline control was connected to all relevant PivotTables to synchronize filtering across the dashboard.

## Step 4 – Dashboard Design and Layout

The dashboard layout follows a structured analytical hierarchy:

1. KPI summary for executive level insights  
2. Weekly performance breakdown for operational monitoring  
3. Interactive filtering for time based scenario analysis  

The design emphasizes clarity, alignment, and readability while maintaining functional interactivity.

# 5. User Interaction Workflow

To use the dashboard:

1. Open the Excel file  
2. Navigate to the Analysis sheet  
3. Use the Timeline slicer to filter by desired date range  
4. Observe KPI updates and weekly trend changes  
5. Analyze shifts in engagement, cost efficiency, and ROI  

All calculations and visuals respond dynamically to user input.
